"Driver Drowsiness Detection and Alerting with Vibration and Watering System " involves leveraging the computational power of Raspberry Pi to develop a system that can detect and mitigate driver drowsiness in real-time. The setup includes a USB camera connected to the Raspberry Pi, which captures live video footage of the driver's face while on the road. Using image processing techniques, various parameters such as lip distance and eye aspect ratio are continuously monitored to assess the driver's level of drowsiness. When signs of drowsiness are detected, indicating potential fatigue or sleepiness, the system triggers
preventive measures to alert the driver and prevent accidents. This includes activating a pump mechanism to release a wake-up agent or scent in the car cabin to stimulate the driver's senses. Additionally, a vibration motor connected via relay is activated to provide physical feedback, such as vibrating the driver's seat, further alerting them to the need for immediate attention. Overall, the proposed system offers a proactive approach to addressing the serious issue of driver drowsiness, particularly during long journeys or monotonous driving conditions. By leveraging Raspberry Pi's capabilities for real-time image processing
and control of peripheral devices, the system aims to enhance road safety and prevent accidents caused by driver fatigue.
